we remote GitHun.com repostory
few things happen : 
1. Iy automatically created new remote repo
under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commit to remote repo


Now our work will continue locally

we want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we pushed local commit to remote repository using push origin button 
Observe it has been added in your repositry under GitHub.com

We do not push one commit at a time
